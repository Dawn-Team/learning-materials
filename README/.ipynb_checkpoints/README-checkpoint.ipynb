    "- Interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based).\n",
    "- A browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other media.\n",
    "- Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.\n",
    "- Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into one's own projects.\n",
    "- Tools for parallel computing.\n",

    "# Our Jupyter Platform Guidelines\n",
    "## Authentication\n",
    "Our platform is configured to authenticate users by Github OAuth ONLY. So the **only way** to access Jupyter platform is using your Github account, which has to be registered on the platform by the administrator(s).  \n",
    "To ensure your account security, when you sign in the platform for the first time, you will see something just like this:\n",
    "![OAuth](images/OAuth.png)\n",
    "Please **confirm** the information marked by red rectangles(**especially the `App Name`, `Privileges` and `the links/urls`**) are absolutely the same or it is a fake one and do **NOT** grant any privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shell Guidelines in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "For what a shell or a shell script really is, please click [Technology Overview of Shell](https://github.com/THUDataPI/TechnologyOverview/blob/master/%E4%B8%80%E6%96%87%E8%AF%BB%E6%87%82Shell/%E4%B8%80%E6%96%87%E8%AF%BB%E6%87%82-Shell-%E9%82%B1%E4%BE%9D%E5%BC%BA.md). Much of the useful information is given there. So in this case, having the `Jupyter Notebook` environment, we will talk about two things:  \n",
    "### The Terminal\n",
    "`Terminal(especially for CLI, Command Line Interface)` is a terminology describing the final software a computer user can touch. It is often available in Unix-like systems or by using `Win` + `R` on windows OS series. We will not discuss this in depth, all you need to know is: \n",
    "1. What is a terminal.\n",
    "2. How to use a terminal when you need to do so.\n",
    "The first one on the list is apparently given and you can get some intuitions about the second by following approaches below:  \n",
    "1. Open a terminal  \n",
    "2. Type this command in your terminal and then hit the `ENTER` button on your keyboard: `ls`(for Unix-like system)/`dir`(for Windows)  \n",
    "3. Observe the output in the terminal, and you can hit `â†‘` and `â†“` to review the commands you've ran.\n",
    "4. You could use `command --help` to find usages, i.e.`ls --help` and the output should be like this:  \n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n",
    "    List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).\n",
    "    Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.\n",
    "    -- more --\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. In a word, type a command followed by your arguments, hit `ENTER` and your cooking is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how to run our shell commands, but how can we do it in Jupyter Notebook, is there a difference?  \n",
    "The answer is no, the approaches are absolutely the same except the first one.  \n",
    "In Jupyter Notebook, we open the terminal by:  \n",
    "1. Turn to a file view page,  \n",
    "2. Click `New` on the upper right of your panel,\n",
    "3. Choose `Terminal` in the list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the approaches described by a sketch:  \n",
    "![Open a ternimal in jupyter notebook](images/Open a ternimal in jupyter notebook.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Shell Scripts in A Running Notebook\n",
    "Instead of running shell scripts in the terminal, you can also choose to run them inside a cell in an open notebook. It seems much easier to run a shell script in the cell but we do *NOT* recommend you to do so in the case of running very complex scripts. \n",
