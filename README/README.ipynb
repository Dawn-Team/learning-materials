Much of the useful information is given there. So in this case, having the `Jupyter Notebook` environment, we will talk about two things:  \n",
    "### The Terminal\n",
    "`Terminal(especially for CLI, Command Line Interface)` is a terminology describing the final software a computer user can touch. It is often available in Unix-like systems or by using `Win` + `R` on windows OS series. We will not discuss this in depth, all you need to know is: \n",
    "1. What is a terminal.\n",
    "2. How to use a terminal when you need to do so.\n",
    "The first one on the list is apparently given and you can get some intuitions about the second by following approaches below:  \n",
    "1. Open a terminal  \n",
    "2. Type this command in your terminal and then hit the `ENTER` button on your keyboard: `ls`(for Unix-like system)/`dir`(for Windows)  \n",
    "3. Observe the output in the terminal, and you can hit `↑` and `↓` to review the commands you've ran.\n",
    "4. You could use `command --help` to find usages, i.e.`ls --help` and the output should be like this:  \n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n",
    "    List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).\n",
    "    Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.\n",
    "    -- more --\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. In a word, type a command followed by your arguments, hit `ENTER` and your cooking is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how to run our shell commands, but how can we do it in Jupyter Notebook, is there a difference?  \n",
    "The answer is no, the approaches are absolutely the same except the first one.  \n",
    "In Jupyter Notebook, we open the terminal by:  \n",
    "1. Turn to a file view page,  \n",
    "2. Click `New` on the upper right of your panel,\n",
    "3. Choose `Terminal` in the list.  \n",

    "### Run Shell Scripts in A Running Notebook\n",
    "Instead of running shell scripts in the terminal, you can also choose to run them inside a cell in an open notebook. It seems much easier to run a shell script in the cell but we do *NOT* recommend you to do so in the case of running very complex scripts. \n",

    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n",
    "- a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    "- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    "- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n",
    "- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n",
    "Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",

    "##### Tensorflow\\cite{tensorflow} \n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.\n",

    "##### Keras\\cite{keras}  \n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).\n",
    "Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.\n",
    "Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.\n",
    "Read the documentation at Keras.io.\n",
