    "# A Brief Introduction to Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Refer to Wikipedia website \\cite{Jupyter Notebook}, a Jupyter Notebook(Jupyter Notebook is also known as IPython) is:  \n",
    "A command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history. IPython provides the following features:  \n",
    "- Interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based).\n",
    "- A browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other media.\n",
    "- Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.\n",
    "- Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into one's own projects.\n",
    "- Tools for parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find some useful information at their [official website](https://jupyter.org/) and we also recommend you to try to install one on your own machine following the instructions the official documents given.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to help you get familiar with this platform, we have several tutorial references:\n",
    "- [IPython Notebook Tutorial(By Stanford)](http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/)\n",
    "- Get involved in [Neural Networks and Deep Learning of Deeplearning.ai specialization](https://mooc.study.163.com/course/cloudclass-2001281002#/info) and switch to `Week2/ Quick Tour Of Jupyter Ipython Notebooks`.\n",

    "# Our Jupyter Platform Guidelines\n",
    "## Authentication\n",
    "Our platform is configured to authenticate users by Github OAuth ONLY. So the **only way** to access Jupyter platform is using your Github account, which has to be registered on the platform by the administrator(s).  \n",
    "To ensure your account security, when you sign in the platform for the first time, you will see something just like this:\n",
    "![OAuth](images/OAuth.png)\n",
    "Please **confirm** the information marked by red rectangles(**especially the `App Name`, `Privileges` and `the links/urls`**) are absolutely the same or it is a fake one and do **NOT** grant any privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Organize Advises\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Kernels and Packages\n",
    "1. kernels.\n",
    "For now, we just support `Python3(Python 3.5.2)` kernel, the default kernel of Jupyter Notebook. We may install some other kernels if they are suggested many times and you can contact administrator(s) for suggesting one if you really need it.  \n",
    "You can create a notebook file(default file name: `Untitled.ipynb`) through the `New` button in the upper right of any directory page and you can see which kernel is running at the upper right place in a open notebook file. \n",
    "2. packages\n",
    "To show the supported packages, just click show solution and use `Shift` + `Enter` to run the cell."

    "1. Open a terminal  \n",
    "2. Type this command in your terminal and then hit the `ENTER` button on your keyboard: `ls`(for Unix-like system)/`dir`(for Windows)  \n",
    "3. Observe the output in the terminal, and you can hit `↑` and `↓` to review the commands you've ran.\n",
    "4. You could use `command --help` to find usages, i.e.`ls --help` and the output should be like this:  \n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n",
